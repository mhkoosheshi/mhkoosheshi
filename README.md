U-Net Pyramid CBAM Gate (UPCG) deplys both CBAM and attention gate in sequence. Experiments show that more attention can lead to less mistakes made by U-Nets and more accuracy especially in difficult scenarios. ( e.g. in the borders ). UPCG managed to beat successful U-Nets such as U-Net-ResNet50, Double U-Net, and R2U-Net, which are also investigated in this study, in these cases. In summary, 4 different augmentation configurations consisted of our hair removal, our hair augmentation and cutmix and mosaic augmentation along with geometrical augmentations offered by albumentations, and 10 different U-Net-based architectures inculding our UPCG were studied.
